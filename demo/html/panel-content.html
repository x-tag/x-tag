<h4>Hey there!</h4>
<p>
	All this content was loaded async as the page parsed the <code>panel</code> tag. Components bound with requests, like <code>panel</code>,
	have default attributes set for readystate and status code values. The background-color animation
	you just witnessed was a CSS transition targeted at the automatically set <code>data-readystate</code> attribute.
